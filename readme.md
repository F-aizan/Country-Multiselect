Hello, there here I have created two folder namely backend for api and react_front for front_end.

Requirements for backend
1. Python==3.7
2. Django==3.2.16
3. djangorestframework==3.14.0

Requirements for react_front

1. "react": "^18.2.0",
2. "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
3. "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
4. "react-select": "^5.5.6",

Steps to run backend
1. For the installation of libraries run pip install django djangorestframework
2. cd backend
3. In terminal run command python manage.py runserver.

Steps to run react_front
1. cd react_front
2. Run npm install react react-dom react-scripts react-select 
3. Open at erminal and run command npm start
4. Click the link in terminal
5. A browser window will open running the app.

Firstly, connect the backend part in order to run the app correctly.

Also, I have only added a few countries in api with the view of extending the range.

I have tested it on Chrome browser with CORS extension installed to allow CORS requests.
For that CORS extension is required to run this on Chrome

Screenshots of the App
